[] Main motive is to create Spring cloud config server which is Git backed.

[] Spring cloud config server can store/access configuration files to Git. So for that we need a Git repository 
   so we will create a Git repository locally or we can also use online Git repository.
   
[] Steps to create Git repository locally:
   1. Open command prompt.
   2. Choose location by using: cd FolderAddress.
   3. Type command [git init] and press enter.
   4. Type command [git status] to display the state of working directory.
   5. In same folder we are making student-service file.
   6. Type command [git add .] and press enter.
   7. Commit the file using [git commit -m "description"] to save the changes to the local repository.
