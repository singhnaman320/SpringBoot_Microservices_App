[] Main motive is to create Spring cloud config server which is Git backed.

[] Spring cloud config server can store/access configuration files to Git. So for that we need a Git repository 
   so we will create a Git repository locally or we can also use online Git repository.
   
[] Steps to create Git repository locally:
   1. Open command prompt.
   2. Choose location by using: cd FolderAddress and the same location/address must be given in application.properties
   3. Type command [git init] and press enter.
   4. In same folder we are making student-service file.
   5. Type command [git status] to display the state of working directory.
   6. Type command [git add .] and press enter.
   7. Commit the file using [git commit -m "description"] to save the changes to the local repository. 
   8. You can access all the properties through browser using:
   	  http://localhost:8086/student-service/default	: for default
   	  http://localhost:8086/student-service/dev : for dev
   	  http://localhost:8086/student-service/prod : for prod
   	  
   	  Similarly for course-service.
